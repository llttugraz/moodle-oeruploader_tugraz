Subplugin for [local_oer](https://github.com/llttugraz/moodle-local_oer) plugin

# Requirements

* Moodle 3.9+
* [local_oer](https://github.com/llttugraz/moodle-local_oer)

# Content

A task will check for new releases and upload the released files to a repository.  
The repository can be setup in the settings of the plugin (token and url).
The [local_oer](https://github.com/llttugraz/moodle-local_oer) also has an endpoint to pull the release information from the system. So this plugin is optional.
